This is a responsive and modern calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a clear interface consisting of a display section for both the current expression and the result. The display has interactive buttons for both digits and for operations, and there are also interface buttons for the other less common operations AC (clear), DE (delete), and = (evaluate). The design uses bright gradients, soft shadows, and rounded corners to help create a clean and modern style aesthetic. The calculator logic is implemented in JavaScript using eval(), which allows for the processing of arithmetic expressions, along with minimal error handling.
